## Calculator Project

This project is based on simple arithmetic operations for personal purposes.
In this project, I will demonstrate how I work with arguments passed by a user from the 'CommandLine' while executing the jar file, with the help of the maven.

## Installation

*For this project I'm using Apache Maven '3.9.0 version' and Java: '17'  version.

```bash
mvn compile
```
*Running tests:
```bash
mvn test
```
*Creating jar:
```bash
mvn package 
```
*Run the jar we have created before:
```bash
java -cp target/"test-SNAPSHOT-0.0.1.jar" "mk.com.test.main.App"
```
